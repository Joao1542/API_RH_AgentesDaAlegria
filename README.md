## API para o RH dos Agentes Da Alegria
  The Agentes Da Alegria group is an NGO that works with any kind of social action,
  like: activities with underprivileged children, visit to children's hospitals, actions with the elderly and special people and much more. 
  In support of the cause I decided to develop this API, an app to consume it and a website to promote the project!  :smile: :smile:

### Motivation
  The group has over 500 volunteers and there is no way to know who is active or not in the actions.
  Therefore, this API is being made to optimize this process.

### How can I use this API?
  The API was made with Node.js, so you will need to have it installed on your computer.

  ***To run the API locally, follow these steps:***
```
git clone https://github.com/Juaozim/API_RH_AgentesDaAlegria
npm install
npm run dev
```
